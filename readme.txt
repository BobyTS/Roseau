Roseau was created for nostalgia purposes, now that this server is almost completed, I've come to realise how basic this shit is.

Thanks to Ascii from Puomi Hotel, and a long time user of Suelake v5 when it was online, he was amazing.
He helped me with SO MUCH that many things would not be possible without him. 

With Ascii, these things were possible:

- wall items loading
- the correct ITEMS structure
- figuring out the correct structure for ACTIVE OBJECTA
- SHOWPROGRAM for the Club Massiva disco lights
- correct structure for teleporters flashing

And of course, lab-hotel from RaGEZONE helped me out with:

- Instant console messaging.
- Enabling the debug window for the version 1 client.
