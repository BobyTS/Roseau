Thanks to Ascii from Puomi Hotel, and a long time user of Suelake v5 when it was online, he was amazing, helped me with SO MUCH that many things would not be possible without him. He helped me with wall items loading, the correct ITEMS structure and 'padding'. SHOWPROGRAM for the Club Massiva disco lights.
