Thanks to Ascii from Puomi Hotel, and a long time user of Suelake v5 when it was online, he was amazing.
He helped me with SO MUCH that many things would not be possible without him. 

With Ascii, these things were possible:

- wall items loading
- the correct ITEMS structure
- figuring out the correct structure for ACTIVE OBJECTA
- SHOWPROGRAM for the Club Massiva disco lights
- correct structure for teleporters flashing
